# Overview

Python demo code for the following cameras:

- MT9V034 (0.36MP Global Shutter Camera)
- AR0134 (1.2MP Global Shutter Camera)
- MT9F002 ï¼ˆ14MP Rolling Shutter Camera)


# Usuage

- Realtime preview

``` sudo python MT9V034 ```

``` sudo python AR0134 ```

- Snapshot

``` sudo python MT9F002 --type jpg --name sample_image ```

## Parameters
--type : jpg, bmp, png

--name : file name without extension

## Window Control
The realtime preview mode supports zoom in/out with control the keyboard

- Zoom in key ' <- '
- Zoom out key ' -> '
- Quit key ' q '

# Troubleshooting
## Window control doesn't work

The keyboard event number might not match your system, using the following command to determine which is your keyboard event

``` cat /proc/bus/input/devices ```

## Frame rate is too slow

The realtime preview performance is not so good on Raspberry Pi board due to the processing power on RAW2RGB convertion and opencv imshow function. In this case the realtime preview is used only for viewfinder purpose, it is recommend to do image processing without realtime display.
